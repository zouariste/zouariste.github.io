# Valentine's Day Interactive Page

A fun, interactive Valentine's Day page where the "Yes" button grows bigger every time they click "No" — with falling hearts, cute GIFs, music, and playful toast messages. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Live demo:** [sahilgogna.github.io/v-day](https://sahilgogna.github.io/v-day)

### Option 2: Fork It and Make It Yours

Want your own version you can customize? Follow these steps:

#### 1. Fork the Repo
- Go to [github.com/SahilGogna/v-day](https://github.com/SahilGogna/v-day)

#### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
- In your forked repo, go to **Settings** (the gear icon tab)
- In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
- Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
- Under **Branch**, select **`main`** and **`/ (root)`**
- Click **Save**

#### 3. Wait ~2 Minutes
- GitHub will build and deploy your site
- Your site will be live at:
  ```
  https://yourusername.github.io/v-day
  ```
  (Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username)

#### 4. Personalize It
- Edit `index.html` to change the question, title, or GIF
- Edit `yes.html` to change the celebration page
- Edit `script.js` to tweak the toast messages, button behavior, or GIF changes
- Edit `style.css` to change colors, fonts, or animations
