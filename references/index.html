                <p><i>“ It is with pleasure that I highly recommend Mr. Mohamed Zouari as a potential candidate for this
                        offer. I am persuaded that he meets all the high standards you require.
                        I have known Mohamed Zouari as a software engineering student in the department of the
                        Information Technology at the National engineering school of Tunis where he attended my
                        “Software engineering” and the “Formal verification” course.
                        While being a student of mine, I can say with confidence that he’s serious and committed to his
                        studies. His dedication and high standards in completing whatever was often remarkable. Mohamed
                        is a very driven and hard-working person. Moreover he has great team member spirit. “

                <p><i>“ I tutored Mohamed during his engineering internship where he was successful in designing and
                        developing a large scale solution for sentiment analysis and monitoring on Twitter using the
                        latest Big data and stream processing technologies. Moreover, I tutored him in his graduation
                        project as well where he successfully contributed to designing and implementing a control and
                        monitoring component for a new distributed and large scale industrial IoT platform.
                        Mohamed is very disciplined, implicated, and hardworking. His enthusiasm, autonomy and teamwork
                        will make him an excellent candidate for software engineering roles. “
